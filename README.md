# Climate Resilience QA System
Developed an AI-powered document-based question-answering system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The system enables users to upload documents and ask natural language questions, receiving accurate, context-based answers generated by an advanced AI model.
The QA System has been hardcoded to retrieve information from a custom curated dataset consisting of research papers related to 'climate resilience strategies' in the political science domain.

# Key Technologies
1. Machine Learning / NLP: Utilized Gemini, a large language model, for natural language understanding and response generation.
2. RAG Framework: Combined document retrieval via embeddings (Gemini embeddings) and query indexing (VectorStoreIndex) with answer generation using the LLM.
3. Python Libraries: Integrated llama_index, google.generativeai, and streamlit for document processing, embedding generation, and building an interactive web app interface.
4. Custom Exception Handling: Implemented robust error management and logging for better system reliability.
